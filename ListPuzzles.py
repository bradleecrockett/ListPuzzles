# Description:  List puzzles are a place to show your understanding of list methods/functions
#       and traversing algorithms.  Complete the following functions as described.  Actual
#       tests may be more extensive than the basic test shown.
#
#     Style - Code format, whitespace and PEP-8 style is followed making code easy to read.
#     Comments - Blocks of code are well commented, every function has a descriptive comment.
#     Tests -   The program runs as described in the specifications without errors(passes all tests).

# Return the number of even ints in the given array (should return an int).
# Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.

Sample Tests
count_evens([2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) → 3
count_evens([2, 2, 0]) → 3
count_evens([1, 3, 5]) → 0

    return "zero"


# Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between
# the largest and smallest values in the array (should return an int).
# Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the
# smaller or larger of two values.
'''
Sample tests
big_diff([10, 3, 5, 6]) → 7
big_diff([7, 2, 10, 9]) → 8
big_diff([2, 10, 7, 2]) → 8
'''
def big_diff(list):

    return "zero"




# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is
# the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest
# values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value,
# ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division
# to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.
# (should return a float)

Sample tests
centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
